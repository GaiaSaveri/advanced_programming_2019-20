//the size of the struct is 8, size of the pointer

//compiler has a virtual table
//each time a children is generated there is line added to that table
//and that line contains a pointer to the virtual function

//function cannot be inlined, doing a function is a jump
//also going from the pointer to the function to the actual addres
//of the function is a jump

//it is not good to have a function that is called many times virtual
//jumps kill the performance
